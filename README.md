Code requires MATLAB. Currently configured for Windows, but just have to adjust the filepaths to use on Ubuntu.

Run the file runAll.m to generate results on the pre-computed features. Note that with the currently provided features, only Scales 1 and 9 are available for testing. However, you are welcome to create your own features.

Please contact me if you want the original Nearmaps dataset, as the total filesize is 140GB.
